# Serum Run

A remote town in the Arctic is facing an imminent diptheria epidemic.  Only you and your party of skilled mushers can get them the antitoxin serum they need.  Or can you?

An Oregon Trail-like game *loosely inspired* by the 1925 serum run to Nome.

Made for Ludum Dare 53 compo (theme: "delivery").  Made using Ink, Godot, and Aseprite. Font is Perfect DOS VGA 437 by Zeh Fernando.

Sorry about there being no sound.  Recommended listening: "Northwest Passage" by Stan Rogers.
