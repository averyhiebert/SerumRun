# Roadmap

## Ideally in first post-jam update
- music
- more content!
- Update GUI for new content
    - visual displayer of loneliness etc.
    - display who is in relationships
    - Question mark next to possible impostor?

## Nice-to-have-eventually:
- improve renaming dialogue
- double-speed option when time remaining is too low?
    - takes an increased toll on party members, of course
- polish
    - in-GUI distinction between "dead" and "abandoned, presumed dead"?
    - clear up "you" vs. party members confusion?
    - consistency regarding whether options have . or not (I think most do)
    - other sound effects besides music
    - grace period for survival sim events?
- map?
- Separate graphics for death messages, endings, scripted events?
- consumables
    - idea: implement as unique items, not quantities. (more streamlined)
    - perhaps there is a probabilistic chance of being consumed?
- balancing
- help/credits?


# Event ideas

## Roadhouse/landmark events?
 - one empty/broken into by a polar bear
 - one with gambling?
    - wager one of your items for one of theirs
 - one with robbers?
    - fight them, possibly shoot them
 - one that has been destroyed by something inexplicable?
    - or simply entirely missing?
 - something supernatural/spooky
 - someone telling a tall tale
 - reference to The Cremation of Sam McGee
 - references to Chaplin film (now public domain)?
 - spooky nightmares? / haunted house
 - choose whether to investigate or shoot at something outside.
 - something spooky in a cave (CAVE DOUBLE)
    - one of the double shrinks from the bible in your hand?

## Travel events?
 - icy lake
 - fallen tree
 - blizzard, obviously
 - find the remains of ill-fated travelers before you?
 - something that lures someone off into the forest, never to return
