# Roadmap

## Must have
- Consistent styling for GUI

## Nice:
- change party member names?
- better win/lose screens (at least make text shake or something)
    - death messages can also shake?
- map? As a streeeetch goal?
- polish!
    - clear up "you" vs. party members confusion?
    - consistency regarding whether options have . or not
    - make deaths more attention-grabbing
- more content!

## Low priority
- Implement using whiskey etc. while traveling
    - lower priority
    - idea: implement as unique items, not quantities. (more streamlined)
    - perhaps there is a probabilistic chance of being consumed?
- balancing
- help/credits?
- sound?


# Event ideas

## Roadhouse/landmark events?
 - one empty/broken into by a polar bear
 - one with gambling?
    - wager one of your items for one of theirs
 - one with robbers?
    - fight them, possibly shoot them
 - one that has been destroyed by something inexplicable?
    - or simply entirely missing?
 - something supernatural/spooky
 - someone telling a tall tale
 - reference to The Cremation of Sam McGee
 - references to Chaplin film (now public domain)?
 - spooky nightmares? / haunted house
 - choose whether to investigate or shoot at something outside.
 - something spooky in a cave (CAVE DOUBLE)
    - one of the double shrinks from the bible in your hand?

## Travel events?
 - icy lake
 - fallen tree
 - blizzard, obviously
 - find the remains of ill-fated travelers before you?
 - something that lures someone off into the forest, never to return
