# Roadmap
- Start on Godot/graphics...
    - minimum background: mountains, forest(?), roadhouse?
    - minimum weather: blizzard, northern lights
- Implement using whiskey etc. while traveling?
    - lower priority
    - idea: implement as unique items, not quantities. (more streamlined)
    - perhaps there is a probabilistic chance of being consumed?
- map selection screen?
    - at very least, should have a viewable map
- better starting loadout selection?
- polish!
    - clear up "you" vs. party members confusion?
    - consistency regarding whether options have . or not
    - make deaths more attention-grabbing
- balancing!
- more content!


# Event ideas

## Roadhouse/landmark events?
 - one empty/broken into by a polar bear
 - one with gambling?
    - wager one of your items for one of theirs
 - one with robbers?
    - fight them, possibly shoot them
 - one that has been destroyed by something inexplicable?
    - or simply entirely missing?
 - something supernatural/spooky
 - someone telling a tall tale
 - reference to The Cremation of Sam McGee
 - references to Chaplin film (now public domain)?
 - spooky nightmares? / haunted house
 - choose whether to investigate or shoot at something outside.
 - something spooky in a cave (CAVE DOUBLE)
    - one of the double shrinks from the bible in your hand?

## Travel events?
 - icy lake
 - fallen tree
 - blizzard, obviously
 - find the remains of ill-fated travelers before you?
 - something that lures someone off into the forest, never to return

## Mechanics

Hunger, tiredness, cold are triggered once per turn when traveling.

### Hunger
May become more hungry if have not eaten recently. 
Meals/sourdough refill 1 level

### Tiredness
May become more tired if not rested recently.  Sleep resets tiredness.

### Coldness
Always can become cold. Sleeping in a cold room is worse.  Resting by the
fire, eating a hot meal, sleeping in warm room all reset a coldness level.

### Injuries/terrified/other status effects
Only triggered by events, cured by recreation/whiskey/other items.

### Lose conditions
Enough bad status effects and party members may die or abandon the party.
